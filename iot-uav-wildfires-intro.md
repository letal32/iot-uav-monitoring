# Internet of Things: Wireless Sensor Networks and Body Area Networks for Firefighting

## The Internet of Things

In the last years, the availability and popularity of the Internet infrastructure has given prominence to a new paradigm called Internet of Things (IoT). This word is used nowadays to describe a broad range of technologies and communication architectures and there is still not a clear consensus on the exact definition of this term.

According to IEEE the Internet of Things can be defined as [1]:

> Internet of Things envisions a self configuring, adaptive, complex network that interconnects "things" to the Internet through the use of standard communication protocols. The interconnected things have physical or virtual representation in the digital world, sensing/actuation capability, a programmability feature and are uniquely identifiable. The representation contains information including the thing’s identity, status, location or any other business, social or privately relevant information. The things offer services, with or without human intervention, through the exploitation of unique identification, data capture and communication, and actuation capability. The service is exploited through the use of intelligent interfaces and is made available anywhere, anytime, and for anything taking security into consideration.”

If the above definition is considered, the IoT is characterized by:

* __Uniquely addressable devices__: the devices have a unique address in the network and have sensors or actuators to interact with the surrounding environment;
* __Devices offer services__: the interconnected devices offer a service through their sensing and actuating interfaces;
* __Connection to the Internet__: the devices, through the direct or indirect connection to the public Internet network, can be accessed anywhere, anytime.

The typical IoT architecture can be logically divided in three layers:

* __Perception Layer__: this layer is responsible for sensing objects and collecting information from the surrounding environment. It is composed of different kind of sensors, depending on the application of the IoT system;
* __Network Layer__: deals with the communication of the information retrieved by the perception layer to one or multiple central nodes by means of appropriate communication protocols. The network layer may be a mobile network, the Internet, radio, satellite, etc.
* __Application Layer__: provides a customized service to the end users by analyzing data coming retrieved by the perception layer. The data is then displayed in order to maximize the end user experience.

This broad definition of IoT includes an equally broad range of possible applications: environment monitoring, health monitoring, smart grids systems, home automation, etc.

For the purpose of this thesis, only environment, health and position monitoring applications for wildfire prevention and firemen support are considered. For a more comprehensive overview of the possible applications, we refer to [2].
