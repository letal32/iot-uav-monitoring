# Scenario Parameters

Some scenario characteristics must be fixed and decided, in order to simulate a situation that is as realistic as possible.

## Environment

* Environment: forest with thick vegetation
* Vegetation type: no assumption
* Maximum trees height: 60 m
* Terrain: flat
* Size: 2000m x 2000m (400 ha) : based on the 24h expansion of Horse River Wildfire
* Simulation time: TBD

## Ground Units

* Team members: 20 : based on size of American hotspot firefighting teams
* Number of teams: constant between 1 and 5 : at most 100 units on ground at the same time
* Mobility model: TBD : teams start from command post and move toward assigned incident area and operates freely inside the area for a certain amount of time. As the time passes and the fire advance, new incident areas are defined and the teams move.
* Operation area: TBD : size of incident area where firemen moves
* Speed: constant 5 km/h : normal walk speed

## Aerial Units

* Max aerial units: TBD
* Speed: constant TBD
* Mobility model: Virtual Spring Forces / Other?
* Height: TBD

## LoRa Protocol Params

* Spreading Factor : TBD
* Transmission power: 14dbm
* Receiver minimum sensitivity : TBD

## EDs data generation

* Periodic: yes/no TBD
* Message size: TBD
