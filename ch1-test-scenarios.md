# Experiments

A series of experiments using the ns-3 network simulator, the LoRa module and the WiFi module will be performed in order to evaluate specific aspects of the involved networks. These experiments are just a preliminary work to understand the capabilities of the ns-3 simulator and of the modules that will be used when more serious simulations will be performed.

## Experiment #1 - LoRa Gateway Coverage

## Experiment #2 - LoRa Gateway Devices Support
