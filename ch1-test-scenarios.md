# Experiments

A series of experiments using the ns-3 network simulator, the LoRa module and the WiFi module will be performed in order to evaluate specific aspects of the involved networks. These experiments are just a preliminary work to understand the capabilities of the ns-3 simulator and of the modules that will be used when more serious simulations will be performed.

## Experiment #1 - LoRa Gateway Coverage

The objective of this experiment is to determine the maximum coverage of a LoRa gateway as a function of the SF used. Additionally also the throughput and the delay are computed for each SF.



Scenario Parameters: 

* Propagation model : Alfa Friis with alfa = 3.29;
* Signal propagation speed: light speed;
* Drone altitude: 60 m;
* LoRa Node Altitude: 1m;
* LoRa Node speed : constant 1 m/s along the x axis;
* Interval between packets : 10 s;
* Transmission Power: 14dBm;
