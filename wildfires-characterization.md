# Problem Definition

In order to tweak the system envisioned and described in the introduction, a thorough research regarding the scenario and the applications in which the system will be used is necessary. The results of this initial research will be used to setup a simulation environment more adherent to the real environment and the most critical situations may be taken into account to evaluate the goodness of the system.

## Wildfire characterization

Wildfires are the among the most destructive events in nature. When these catastrophic events happen, large forest areas are completely destroyed by fire and human lives in close urban areas are put at risk.

Wildfires represent a worldwide problem, but America and Europe are the two continents where the incidence of forest fires is higher \[2\]\[3\]. The costs, in terms of economic losses and human deaths, are  considerable.

Considering only the European continent, the Mediterranean region is the most affected by forest fires. This region comprises countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and Greece [4]. The image below shows the impact of fires in this region in terms of number of occurrences and area burnt [5].

As an example, in the period between 1975 and 2007 about 3,8 x 10^6 ha of land were burned by fires in Portugal, which correspond to approximately 40% of the surface of the country [1].

The causes of wildfires are still not clear in many circumstances, but in most of the known situations the starting event is caused by human activity. Most of the times fires are not voluntarily created, but are instead caused by human negligence or risky behaviors in situations like barbecues or agricultural burnings to remove unwanted biomass or for managing forestry. The purely natural cause, where the fire starts only due to natural causes (mainly lightning), represents only a small percentage of the total fires [4].

Focusing solely in Portugal, Large Forest Fires  (LFF) are defined as those fires that burns an area of at least 100 acres (approximately 1 km^2). Even if these fires are relatively rare in Portugal (0.7% of the total), their incidence in terms of burnt area increased by 10% compared to the previous decade. The most common LFFs are the ones covering an area between 100 and 500 ha (77% of total LFFs). These fires are responsible for burning 40% of the area burnt by LFFs. Among the LFFs, the second most common fires are the ones covering an area between 1000 and 5000 acres (8.7% of total LFFs), which correspond to 30.9% of the total burnt area by LFFs. LFFs, even if relatively rare are the ones that are more difficult to manage and where the intervention of multiple fire brigades is necessary.

## Fire Suppression Techniques

Knowing how wildfires are suppressed by fire brigades is a necessary step in order to understand the movement patterns of firemen and how they behave on the ground
