# VS Forces Experiments

In this document, the rusults of some basic experiments using virtual forces algorithm to form a mesh network are described.

## Basic LoRa Wifi Mesh network

In this experiment, a simple network scenario is created. There will be some LoRa nodes in a fixed position and some UAVs interacting using a simplified version of the VSF algorithm that only accounts for forces among UAVs. The UAVs form a WiFi mesh network using DSDV as routing algorithm to relay the LoRa packets to the base station. The purpose of this experiment is to test a very simple confguration of the network to spot problems related to implementation. 

### Objectives

* Test basic VSF algorithm
* Test relaying function of UAVs
* Test and configure a mesh WiFi network running DSDV in ns-3




## LoRa forest scenario range

## WiFi free path range
