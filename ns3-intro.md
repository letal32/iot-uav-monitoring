# The ns-3 Network Simulator 

ns-3, acronym that stands for network simulator 3, is a discrete event simulator built in C++. Its principal purpose is the simulation of networks based on the IP protocol, even if multiple modules are available to simulate non-IP networks. ns3 is highly modular and allows for an easy integration of different network models that can be linked together in a very easy and flexible way. This modularity allows the usage of already existing well tested and well document models to build new functionalities or simulation scripts.

ns-3 is a discrete event simulator. As such, all the events that may arise in the network (e.g. sending/reception of a packet) are previously determined and scheduled for execution at a specific time. When the simulation start, the scheduled events start being executed in order until the last event is completed. During the simulation, new events can be dynamically added to the scheduler. 

Moreover ns-3 is completely open source and distributed under the GNU GPLv2 license.

## Basic concepts

In ns-3 it's possible to distinguish the following basic components:

* __Nodes__: they are abstractions of the physical devices that form the network (e.g. mobile phones, PCs, sensors) and they are instances of the Node class. When they are instantiated, they are just empty containers in which it's possible to install applications, net devices, protocols, etc.
* __Applications__: abstractions of the applications running on the network devices. They give the ability to the devices to perform particular tasks, for example sending or receiving UDP packets. Every application is an instance of the Application class that has been specialized by the author of the application in order to perform a certain function;
* __Channels__: a network needs some sort of connection among the devices. The connection can be physical (e.g. an Ethernet cable) or wireless. In ns-3 all these connections are modeled with a specialization of the Channel class;
* __Net Devices__: in the simulator logic, they substitute Network Interface Cards (NIC) and the drivers necessary to operate the network. They allow a node to communicate to another node through a channel. Every net device is a specialization of the NetDevice class;
* __Helpers__: tools that simplify the process of creating a network by providing specific methods to create set of nodes, install net devices and channels and configure the protocol stack.

ns-3 implements also some systems to collect and analyze the data generated by the simulation:

* __Logging module__: this module allows to display messages in the terminal during the execution of the simulation. The logging module is organized in levels, ordered based on an increasing level of verbosity. The logging module can be enabled for all the components of the simulation or only for some modules;
* __Tracing system__: the logging module is useful during the debugging phase, but it's inefficient when the real simulation is executing. For this reason, ns-3 implements a tracing system based on the concepts of tracing source and tracing sink. A trace source is a piece of code that signals the occurrence of a particular event during the simulation (e.g. a packet is sent). A trace source needs to be linked to a trace sink that consumes the event fired by the trace source. The trace sink makes active use of the callback mechanism to invoke a user-defined function to process the event fired by the trace source.

The topology of the network, the nodes mobility model and the setup of the simulation parameters are done in the main body of the simulation script.
